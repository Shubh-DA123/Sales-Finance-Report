# Sales-Finance-Report

🎯 My First Step into Data Analytics with Excel!
 I’m super excited to share my latest project — a Sales Performance Analysis for a company, Atliq Hardwares, built entirely using Microsoft Excel.
📊 In this project, I created multiple business reports to explore:
🔍 Customer Performance (Amazon grew over 200%!)
🌍 Market vs Target Sales (India topped in revenue, but missed targets)
💰 Profit & Loss Reports (by Year, Market, and Month)
📈 Trends in sales and gross margin across regions and time

All reports were designed using:
 ✅ Pivot Tables
 ✅ Conditional Formatting
 ✅ Formulas like SUMIF, VLOOKUP, and % Growth
 ✅ Filters & Clean Layouts
 
🧠 What I learned:
How to turn raw data into actionable insights.
How business KPIs like gross margin and YoY growth work.
Reporting logic using real-life metrics.
